# Advanced Aiming System

[Advanced Aiming System](http://www.koreanrandom.com/forum/topic/16559-/) is a mod for World of Tanks. It is based on X-Mod library.

## Installation

Mod does not require any special installation, just unpack archive to your res_mods folder.

**Do not forget to install X-Mod library.**

## Configuration

All configuration could be made by editing config files. All descriptions are provided in comments to parameters.

*Important: Do not use standard Windows `Notepad` for editing config files! It breaks encoding and file will not be read properly ingame.*

## Loading and loader scripts

Mod is not sensitive to loading location, but main config file should have the same name and be in the same folder as the script.
So you can add `mod_` to script's and config's names simultaneously and move them to `res_mods/<patch>/script/client/gui/mods` folder
instead of `res_mods/<patch>/script/client/mods`. This approach does not require loaders, but initial start will be later than in
`res_mods/<patch>/script/client/mods`, so some plug-ins may not work properly in case of 'cross-mods hook conflict'. Be careful.
